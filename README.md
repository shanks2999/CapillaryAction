# Capillary Action

  This project aims to visualize the trajectories of various water molecules when the capillary action is observed. It also intends to visualize how the liquid-solid as well as the liquid-liquid contact in the interface changes over time. A deeper understanding of the properties of liquid-liquid and liquid-solid molecule contact can aid in the construction of surfaces which sustain liquid-liquid contact but obstruct liquid-solid contact. This, in turn, would lead to progress in the field of research on non-stick surfaces.
